          <p>
            Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
            payment of any applicable fees, Bridge grants to the User a

          <h4>2.4 Consent for Children Under 16</h4>

          <p>
            By using our service, you represent and warrant that you are at
            least 16 years of age. No one under the age of 16 may use the
            Service, except as set forth as follows.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bridge is not directed to children, and we expect that any use by
            children will only be done with the guidance, supervision and
            consent of their parents, guardians and/or authorized school
            officials. If you are under the age of 16 you must receive consent
            from a parent, guardian and/or an authorized school official to use
            the Service. Bridge relies on parents and guardians to ensure that
            minors only use Bridge if they can understand their rights and
            responsibilities as laid out in these Terms of Service and in our{' '}

          <p>
            If you are an authorized school official in the United States or in
            the EU and want your students, who are under the age of 16, to
            create Bridge accounts, you are responsible for complying with the
            U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and, to the
            extent applicable, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
            ("FERPA"), or the GDPR policy, respectively. This means that you
            must notify the students' parents/guardians of the personally
            identifiable information that Bridge will collect, and that you will
            obtain parental/guardian consent before your students establish
            accounts or use Bridge. When obtaining such consent, you must
            provide their parents or guardians with a copy of our{' '}

            and keep all consents on file and provide them to us upon request.

            you to obtain any required consent or approval from the parent or
            guardian of any student covered by similar laws, and, as a condition
            to your and your students' use of Bridge, you agree that you will be
            responsible for complying with such laws.
